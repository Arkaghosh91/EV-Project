# EV-Population study Project
## Overview : This project aims to analyze the adoption and distribution of electric vehicles across various regions. By examining factors such as electric vehicle type, range, and geographic distribution, the project seeks to provide insights into the current state of EV adoption. It will also explore the correlation between EV adoption and factors like legislative districts, utility providers, and geographic regions.
### Objective : The primary objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the distribution and characteristics of electric vehicles in different regions. The analysis will focus on:

1. Identifying trends in EV adoption by make, model, and type.
2. Exploring the geographic distribution of EVs and their correlation with regional factors like legislative districts and utility providers.
3. Assessing the range and eligibility of vehicles for clean alternative fuel incentives.
4. Providing data-driven insights to support the expansion and adoption of electric vehicles.
This analysis will serve as a valuable resource for stakeholders, including policymakers, utility companies, and automotive manufacturers, to understand the landscape of electric vehicle adoption and plan future strategies accordingly.

### Tools used : MS EXCEL VERSION 2016 , TABLEAU PUBLIC 2024.2.1.
#### Conclusion : This project provides an in-depth analysis of the electric vehicle (EV) population, focusing on various aspects such as vehicle types, manufacturers, model years, and geographic distribution. The data reveals several key trends:

1. Dominance of BEVs: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are the most prevalent type of EV, indicating a strong preference for fully electric vehicles over plug-in hybrids.

2. Tesla's Market Leadership: Tesla is the clear leader in the EV market, with nearly half of all EVs in the dataset being Tesla models. This suggests that Tesla's brand, technology, and range are significant factors driving EV adoption.

3. Rising Adoption Rates: The steady increase in EV registrations, particularly from 2018 to 2023, reflects growing consumer interest and possibly the impact of incentives and a broader range of available models.

4. Regional Concentration: The majority of EVs are concentrated in a few key counties, with King County being the most prominent. This concentration may be due to factors such as urbanization, higher income levels, and greater availability of charging infrastructure in these areas.

5. Moderate Electric Range: The average electric range of approximately 68 miles highlights the diversity in range capabilities among different models. While many newer models offer significantly higher ranges, the presence of lower-range vehicles suggests that range anxiety may still be a concern for some consumers.

Overall, the findings from this analysis can be valuable for stakeholders, including policymakers, utility companies, and automotive manufacturers, in understanding the current landscape of EV adoption. This insight can guide future strategies to enhance EV infrastructure, promote EV-friendly policies, and address potential barriers to broader EV adoption
